# Analysis_touch_task
The respective behavioral touch task originally generates logfiles that are too unorganized to be used for direct data analysis.

The first file (first run analysis) takes the timed data from the first run of the experiment, organizes it, and gives initial results of which touch modalieties are experienced to be the most distinctive/pleasant/unpleasant.

The second file (second run analysis) takes the timed data from the second run of the experiment, organizes it, and analyses the final data from the respective run for each subject.
